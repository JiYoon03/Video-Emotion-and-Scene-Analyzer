# Video-Emotion-and-Scene-Analyzer
This repository contains a full-stack application that takes a raw video file and turns it into structured, human-readable insights: transcript, scenes, frame captions, and emotions. The backend is built with FastAPI + Celery + Redis, and the frontend is built with Next.js (React + TypeScript).
